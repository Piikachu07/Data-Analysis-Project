Datset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
Content Highlights:
Objective:
The notebook focuses on detecting credit card fraud using a dataset, likely employing machine learning techniques for anomaly detection or classification.
Data Handling:
Data is loaded and preprocessed, including:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns in fraud and non-fraud cases.
Visualizations to highlight anomalies or feature distributions.
Feature Engineering:
Techniques applied to improve model performance.
Considerations for handling imbalanced datasets, as fraud data often comprises a small fraction of the total.
Machine Learning Models:
Multiple models may have been explored (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Isolation Forest).
Evaluation metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC to assess performance.
Results and Interpretations:
Emphasis on explaining model performance and how it distinguishes between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
