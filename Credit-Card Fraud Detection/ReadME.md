# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Objective
The goal of this project is to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. Given the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset, particular focus is placed on anomaly detection and classification methods.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle: Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). It contains anonymized features derived from Principal Component Analysis (PCA), along with the transaction amount and class label (fraudulent or legitimate).

## Project Highlights

### 1. Data Handling
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** The dataset was carefully loaded and prepared for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Key patterns and differences between fraudulent and legitimate transactions were analyzed.
- **Visualizations:** Anomalies and feature distributions were visualized to gain insights into the dataset.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Applied techniques to improve model performance, such as scaling and selecting important features.
- Special considerations were taken to handle the class imbalance, as fraudulent transactions comprise a small fraction of the total dataset.

### 3. Machine Learning Models
- Multiple models were explored, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Isolation Forest (for anomaly detection)
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Model performance was assessed using metrics such as:
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
  - ROC-AUC

### 4. Results and Interpretations
- Highlighted the effectiveness of the chosen models in distinguishing fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones.
- Provided detailed explanations of the model results and performance metrics.
